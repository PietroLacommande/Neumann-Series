# Simplifying Inverse Matrix Calculation with the Neumann Series

This repository provides an implementation of the Neumann series to approximate the inverse of a matrix.
The Neumann series method is particularly useful for matrices that are close to the identity matrix, offering a computationally efficient alternative to direct inversion.

## Overview

Matrix inversion can be computationally expensive, especially for large matrices.
The Neumann series offers a way to approximate the inverse for matrices \( A \) where \( \|I - A\| \) is small. This repository includes:
- An explanation of the Neumann series for matrix inversion.
- An implementation in CUDA.
- MATLAB code for generating a matrix A, calculating the follow up matrixes for Neumann series and calculating the inverse of matrix A
